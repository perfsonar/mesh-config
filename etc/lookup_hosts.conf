## Use ls_instance to point at the lookup service from which you wish to build
## the list of hosts. It is HIGHLY recommended this is a private lookup service
## since you don't have control over what other people register in the public 
## lookup services. You may specify 
ls_instance http://private-ls1:8090/lookup/records

## You may specify ls_instance multiple times to query multiple lookup services
#ls_instance http://private-ls2:8090/lookup/records
#ls_instance http://private-ls3:8090/lookup/records
#ls_instance http://private-ls4:8090/lookup/records


## Query objects are used to define what you want to pull out of the lookup service
## and to define some manual settings for the configuration built from that list.
## This query object grabs all BWCTL services in the es.net domain, points them at 
## a central archive, and adds some tags to the configuration that can be used in host_classes
<query>
    ## service_type is required. It indicates what type of service we want to grab.
    ## This corresponds to the lookup services' service-type field. It can be any valid 
    ## value for tha field, but is usually 'bwctl or 'owamp'. You can have multiple of 
    ## these in the same query and it will grab services matching any one of the types you specified.
    service_type bwctl
    
    ## filters are fine-grained ways to tell the lookup service exactly what services 
    ## you care about. The filters only grabs records that have the 'group-domains' field
    ## set to es.net. You can have 0 or more filter blocks in this file.
    <filter>
        ## You can only have one of these per filter object. Corresponds to a key name
        ## in a lookup service record. For a list of common values, see
        ## https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dEROeTwW0R4qcLHKnA2fsWEz8fQWnPKSpPVf_FuB2Vc/pub
        filter_key group-domains
        
        ## The value you want to match against. Only one of these per filter object as well. 
        filter_value es.net
    </filter>
    
    ## output_settings is where you provide some more details about what you want 
    ## the generated configuration to look like. You can have 0 or 1 of these blocks
    ## per query block. 
    <output_settings>
        ## Sets the organization 'description' in the output configuration. 
        ## All hosts that match this query will be included in this organization.
        ## If not set, no value will be set for description and hosts will belong to a nameless
        ## organization block.
        organization_name ESnet
        
        ## Sets the measurement archive you want the hosts that match this query to use. 
        ## Corresponds to the measurement archive block in your standard MeshConfig file
        ## You can have 0 or more of these, but each type must only appear once in this
        ## output_settings block. As you may have deduced, this file  assumes you are 
        ## using a central MA for storing results from the records that match this query. 
        <measurement_archive>
            ## type is the same as the measurement_archive 'type' in MeshConfig. Valid values
            ## are perfsonarbuoy/bwctl, perfsonarbuoy/owamp, traceroute, and pinger.
            ## perfsonarbuoy/bwctl means store throughput data, perfsonarbuoy/owamp 
            ## means one-way delay data, traceroute means traceroute/tracepath/other path
            ## tracing tools, and pinger means ping data. Some of those are legacy names,
            ## so sorry if they are confusing. Most likely you will be sending all types to 
            ## the same place.
            type perfsonarbuoy/bwctl
            type traceroute
            
            ## The URL where things like graphs and dashboards can get the stored results
            read_url http://perfsonar-archive.es.net/esmond/perfsonar/archive

        </measurement_archive>
        
        ## Tags are ways to arbitrarily markup your configuration. You can use it 
        ## to build host_classes in the MeshConfig and do lots of interesting ways. Tags
        ## apply to organizations, sites, hosts and addresses. As such there is a 
        ## organization_tag, site_tag, host_tag and address_tag option. You can have 0 
        ## or more of each of these
        organization_tag esnet
        site_tag bwctl_site
        host_tag linux
